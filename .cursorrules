This project follows DevRail development standards.
See DEVELOPMENT.md for the complete reference.

Critical Rules:

1. Run `make check` before completing any story or task. Never mark work done
   without passing checks. This is the single gate for all linting, formatting,
   security, and test validation.
2. Use conventional commits. Every commit message follows the
   `type(scope): description` format. No exceptions.
3. Never install tools outside the container. All linters, formatters, scanners,
   and test runners live inside `ghcr.io/devrail-dev/dev-toolchain:v1`. The
   Makefile delegates to Docker. Do not install tools on the host.
4. Respect `.editorconfig`. Never override formatting rules (indent style, line
   endings, trailing whitespace) without explicit instruction.
5. Write idempotent scripts. Every script must be safe to re-run. Check before
   acting: `command -v tool || install_tool`, `mkdir -p`, guard file writes with
   existence checks.
6. Use the shared logging library. No raw `echo` for status messages. Use
   `log_info`, `log_warn`, `log_error`, `log_debug`, and `die` from
   `lib/log.sh`.

Quick Reference:

- Run `make check` to validate all standards
- Run `make help` to see available targets
- All tools run inside the dev-toolchain container
