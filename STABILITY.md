# Stability

DevRail is in **beta** (`v0.x`). The project is under active development.

## What "Beta" Means

- **Standards may change.** Section content, naming, and structure may be revised as we learn from real-world usage.
- **Tooling may change.** Tool versions, container contents, and Makefile targets may be updated without prior deprecation.
- **No backward-compatibility guarantee.** Until `v1.0.0`, any release may include breaking changes. Pin to a specific tag if you need stability.
- **Feedback is welcome.** File issues, open discussions, or submit PRs. Early adopters shape the final product.

## Component Status

For the full component-by-component status table, see the [dev-toolchain STABILITY.md](https://github.com/devrail-dev/dev-toolchain/blob/main/STABILITY.md).

## Versioning

All DevRail repos use `v0.x.y` during beta. The `0.x` range signals that breaking changes may occur in any release, per [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) conventions.

Once the core standards, toolchain image, and CI templates are stable and validated in production use, we will release `v1.0.0` and commit to backward compatibility.

## How to Track Changes

- Watch the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) in each repo for release-by-release details.
- Breaking changes will be called out explicitly in changelog entries during beta.
